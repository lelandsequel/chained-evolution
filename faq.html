            <h3 class="faq-question">What is Chained Evolution?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Chained Evolution is a boutique fitness studio in Waltham, MA, founded in 2017. We integrate cutting-edge technology like InBody 570 and Fit3D scanning with personalized coaching for data-driven fitness results.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Who is Chained Evolution for?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Chained Evolution is for adults who are serious about improving their fitness but want a sustainable, data-driven approach. Our clients value consistency over intensity and want coaching that fits their life—not the other way around.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Who is Chained Evolution NOT for?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We're not the right fit if you're looking for extreme transformations in 30 days, want a coach who will yell at you, or expect results without putting in consistent effort. We don't do fads, quick fixes, or empty hype.</p>
          </div>

        <!-- Our Technology -->
        <div class="faq-category">
          <h2 class="faq-category-title reveal-up">Our Technology</h2>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What is InBody 570?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">The InBody 570 is a medical-grade body composition analyzer that uses bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure your body's composition in under 60 seconds. Unlike basic scales, it breaks down your weight into muscle mass, body fat, and water—and shows exactly where fat and muscle are distributed across your body. It's the same technology used in hospitals, research facilities, and elite athletic programs.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What is Fit3D?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Fit3D is a 3D body scanner that creates a precise digital avatar of your body using infrared sensors. In 40 seconds, it captures hundreds of body measurements and tracks changes over time with visual comparisons. You can literally see your body transform—not just numbers on a scale, but actual shape changes in 3D.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Why use both InBody and Fit3D?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">InBody tells you what's happening inside (muscle gain, fat loss, hydration). Fit3D shows you what's happening outside (measurements, posture, visual changes). Together, they give you the complete picture. You might lose 5 pounds of fat and gain 3 pounds of muscle—the scale says you only lost 2 pounds, but InBody and Fit3D show the real transformation.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What makes Chained Evolution different from other studios?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Most gyms guess. We measure. While other studios rely on the scale and subjective assessments, we use clinical-grade body composition technology to track exactly what's changing. Combined with individualized programming (not cookie-cutter templates) and genuine coaching relationships, you get a fitness experience that's truly personalized and results-driven. We're a small studio by design—that means you're never just another member.</p>

        <!-- Training -->
        <div class="faq-category">
          <h2 class="faq-category-title reveal-up">Training</h2>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What training methods do you use?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We use evidence-based strength training principles—progressive overload, proper movement patterns, and individualized programming. Every program is built around your goals, schedule, and current fitness level, informed by objective body composition data.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need to be in shape to start?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">No. We work with clients at all fitness levels. Your program is designed for where you are now, not where you think you should be. Everyone starts somewhere.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How often should I train?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Most clients train 2-4 times per week, depending on goals and schedule. We'll discuss what's realistic for you and build a program around that frequency.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What happens in the first session?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">The first session includes a body composition scan, movement assessment, goal discussion, and an introductory workout. It's designed to understand your current abilities and set a data-driven baseline for your program.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Results -->

            <h3 class="faq-question">What results can I expect?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Results vary based on effort, consistency, and starting point. Most clients see measurable improvements in strength within 4-6 weeks. Body composition changes typically become visible around 8-12 weeks with consistent training and nutrition.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How do you track progress?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We use InBody 570 body composition scans and Fit3D 360-degree scanning to objectively measure changes in fat, muscle, and water distribution. No guesswork—just data.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item reveal-up">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Do you provide nutrition plans?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We offer nutrition coaching as a separate service or bundled with training. We focus on sustainable habits and education rather than rigid meal plans. Specific dietary guidance is provided within our scope of practice.</p>
